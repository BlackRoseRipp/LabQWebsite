#QSure Website

by Thomas Ripp

I wrote the home page, the Corporations page, and the Members page along with the Navbar to switch between them.
I built this on the newest version of React so the newest version must be installed to run it locally.
I used Material UI along with React to make the UI cleaner.

To use it locally:
###  git clone this repo

###  cd website

### `npm install

###  npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
